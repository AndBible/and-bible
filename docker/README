About:

AndBible's build system requires a newer version of nodejs than is packaged
for Ubuntu 20.04.  As a result I can no longer build AndBible.  I created
this Docker image based on Ubuntu 22.04 so that I can use it to build
AndBible.

I build the docker image, then I run it using a directory that I have
prepared to be my "home" directory within the container.  The contents of
this directory are accessible from outside the container, and remain even
when the container is stopped.  It contains my dotfiles (.zshrc, .zshenv,
.vimrc, .gitconfig), the .android directory where Android Studio stores
various data, and my git repository for AndBible.  I also mount the
directory with the X11 UNIX Domain Sockets into the container so GUI
applications (Android Studio in particular) can be run.  This directory is
not my home directory on the host OS.



Build the Docker image:  

    $ docker image build -t andbible-dev \
        --build-arg MY_UID=`id -u` \
        ./docker/

Run the Docker container:  

    $ docker container run \
        --interactive --tty \
        --name andbible-dev \
        --user `id -u`:`id -g` \
        --network="host" \
        -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
        -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro \
        -v `pwd`:/space/home/:rw \
        andbible-dev:latest
