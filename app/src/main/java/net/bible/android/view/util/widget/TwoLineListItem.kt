/**
 *
 * A view group with two children, intended for use in ListViews. This item has two
 * [TextViews][android.widget.TextView] elements (or subclasses) with the ID values
 * [text1][android.R.id.text1]
 * and [text2][android.R.id.text2]. There is an optional third View element with the
 * ID [selectedIcon][android.R.id.selectedIcon], which can be any View subclass
 * (though it is typically a graphic View, such as [ImageView][android.widget.ImageView])
 * that can be displayed when a TwoLineListItem has focus. Android supplies a
 * [standard layout resource for TwoLineListView][android.R.layout.two_line_list_item]
 * (which does not include a selected item icon), but you can design your own custom XML
 * layout for this object.
