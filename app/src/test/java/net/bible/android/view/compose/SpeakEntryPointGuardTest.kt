/**
 * Round 13a T4: the two Compose Speak activities were deleted — the Compose Speak entry point
 * moves to a bottom sheet over the reading view (Task 13). This guard makes the deletion durable:
 * a regression that re-adds either file would otherwise only be noticed if something else broke.
 *
 * Deliberately a source scan (relative to the `:app` module dir, the working directory for its
 * unit tests) rather than a reflective "class not found", matching [MenuSeamGuardTest]'s pattern.
