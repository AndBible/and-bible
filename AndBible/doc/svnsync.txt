How do I import an existing Subversion repository?
To upload the history of an existing Subversion repository, use the svnsync tool that ships with Subversion 1.4 or later. Run svnsync help to read more about this tool.

Note that your Google Code repository must be reset to revision 0 for this to work. Your project's Source tab will display instructions on how to reset the repository yourself. (Note: you must be a project owner to reset your own repository, and also to push code up with svnsync.)

Here's a sample transcript that demonstrates how you can push history from an existing repository (located at file:///my/repos) to your repository on Google Code:

  $ svnsync init --username YOURUSERNAME https://YOURPROJECT.googlecode.com/svn file:///path/to/localrepos
  Copied properties for revision 0.
  $ svnsync sync --username YOURUSERNAME https://YOURPROJECT.googlecode.com/svn
  Committed revision 1.
  Copied properties for revision 1.
  Committed revision 2.
  Copied properties for revision 2.

When prompted for your password, use your googlecode.com password, which can be found on the settings tab of your profile page.

Running svnsync on a large repository will take a significant amount of time. If you are disconnected during the process, you may see the error message "svnsync: Couldn't get lock on destination repos after 10 attempts". If this happens, you can remove the lock yourself; see the "Locks" section of svnsync.txt.
