About=The NET Bible®, First Edition, is a completely new translation of the Bible (several millions of dollars, thousands of hrs volunteer labor across 10 yrs), not a revision or an update of a previous English version but was translated by biblical scholars who worked directly from the best currently available Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts The NET Bible®, contains over 63,000 notes. These notes are not like those in other bibles as has been attested to by bible scholars, Christian leaders, , pastors, lay leaders, and missionaries e.g. Kenneth L. Barker  General Editor,  NIV Study Bible and TNIV Study Bible says " “The translators’ notes, study notes, and text-critical notes alone are worth the price of the NET Bible®.” Wayne Grudem a Member, Translation Oversight Committee, ESV said, “The extensive and reliable notes in the NET Bible® were a wonderful help to our translation team as we worked to prepare the English Standard Version.”  Charles Swindoll radio host of Insight for Living says, “The NET Bible® is a Bible you can trust. The translation is clear, accurate, and powerful. And the notes, those wonderful notes! They bring to the layman scholarly insights and discussions that have up till now been accessible only to those trained in the biblical languages. If you are serious about studying Scripture, get a copy of the NET Bible®.”  Dr. Tony Evans Senior Pastor and the host of The Urban Alternative, radio broadcast, says, ““The complaint I hear from many Christians is that some of the translations of the Bible are too wooden. They are grammatically correct, but don’t seem to convey the passion of the writer. On the flip side, some paraphrases and translations convey the passion of the writer at the cost of an accurate translation. The NET Bible® is the best of both worlds. The notes are helpful to the scholar and the layperson alike. This is the Bible for the next millennium.... ” See other endorsements at http://www.bible.org/endorsements. \par \par Special note for Sword users: We have received many requests for the production of Sword modules.
