Powerful Bible Study tool

"AndBible: Bible Study" is a powerful, yet easy to use, offline Bible study application for Android. The app does not aim to be simply a Bible reader, but focuses on being an advanced tool to do in-depth personal Bible study.

This application is developed by Bible readers, for Bible readers. It aims at helping you make your Bible study convenient, deep and fun. The best part about this non-profit community project is that it is open-source, completely free, and contains no advertisements.

A few popular Bible versions (of the many available) are KJV, NASB, NET, and also popular commentaries like Matthew Henry and John Gill.

 * Split text views that enable comparing translations and consulting commentaries
 * Workspaces allow multiple Bible study setups with their own settings
 * Strong's integration allows Greek and Hebrew word analysis
 * Linked cross-references, footnotes, and documents; jump to cross-references and footnotes by simply tapping a link; perform in-depth study of the Scriptures by using hyperlinked commentaries (Gill, Matthew Henry etc.), cross-reference collections (Treasure of Scripture Knowledge, TSKe) and other resources.
